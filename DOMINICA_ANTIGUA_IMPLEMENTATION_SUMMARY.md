# Implementation Summary: Dominica and Antigua & Barbuda Lottery Games

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of lottery games for Dominica and Antigua & Barbuda in the Today's Numbers application. The implementation follows the existing pattern used for other Caribbean islands and includes all required games with proper data formatting.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Mock Data Implementation

The mock data for both islands has been added to the `LotteryContext.tsx` file:

#### Dominica Games:
1. **Play 4** - Multi-draw game with Morning, Midday, and Evening draws
2. **Daily 3** - Multi-draw game with Midday and Evening draws
3. **Big 4** - Multi-draw game with Morning and Evening draws
4. **1-Off** - Single draw game
5. **Pick 2** - Multi-draw game with Morning and Evening draws
6. **Super 6** - Single draw game with jackpot information

#### Antigua & Barbuda Games:
1. **Super Lotto** - Single draw game with jackpot information
2. **Lucky Pick** - Single draw game

### 2. Data Schema Compliance

All mock data follows the required schema:
- `island`: String identifier for the island
- `game`: Game name
- `draw_date`: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `draw_time`: Time or label (e.g., "Evening", "21:00")
- `draw_number`: Unique identifier for the draw
- `numbers`: Array of winning numbers
- `jackpot`: Jackpot amount if available
- `drawDateFormatted`: Formatted date for display
- `jackpotFormatted`: Formatted jackpot with currency

### 3. Multi-Draw Game Implementation

Multi-draw games use the `draws` array structure as specified in the requirements:
- Each draw in the array contains all required fields
- The LotteryCard component already supports this structure through the `isMultiDrawGame` function
- Tabbed interface is automatically rendered for games with multiple draws

### 4. Currency Formatting

Currency formatting follows the requirements:
- **Dominica**: EC$200,000 for Super 6 jackpot
- **Antigua & Barbuda**: EC$1,637,500 for Super Lotto jackpot

### 5. Test Components and Routes

Added test components and routes to verify the implementation:
- `TestDominicaAntigua.tsx` - Basic test component
- `TestNewIslands.tsx` - Enhanced test component with better UI
- `/test-da` and `/test-new-islands` routes in App.tsx

## Code Changes

### 1. LotteryContext.tsx

Modified to include:
- Added 'dominica' and 'antigua' to the mockIslands array
- Added mock data for both islands with all required games
- Properly formatted all data fields according to specifications

### 2. App.tsx

Modified to include:
- Import statements for new test components
- New routes for testing the implementation

### 3. New Files Created

- `TestDominicaAntigua.tsx` - Basic test component
- `TestNewIslands.tsx` - Enhanced test component
- `verifyImplementation.ts` - Verification script
- `DOMINICA_ANTIGUA_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This document

## Verification

The implementation has been verified to ensure:
- All required games are implemented
- Data follows the specified schema
- Multi-draw games use the correct structure
- Currency formatting is correct
- Date formats follow the YYYY-MM-DD specification
- Test components and routes are functional

## Backend Integration

The backend scraper will need to be updated to:
1. Scrape lottery results from official sources for both islands
2. Return data in the same format as existing islands
3. Map the fields correctly to match the frontend expectations

The expected JSON format from the backend:
```json
{
  "island": "Dominica",
  "operator": "Dominica National Lottery",
  "games": [
    {
      "game": "Play 4",
      "numbers": [3, 15, 8, 22],
      "draw_date": "2025-09-14",
      "draw_time": "Evening",
      "draw_number": "20250914-P4",
      "jackpot": null
    },
    {
      "game": "Super 6",
      "numbers": [1, 9, 13, 15, 16, 19],
      "draw_date": "2025-09-12",
      "draw_time": "21:00",
      "draw_number": "20250912-S6",
      "jackpot": 200000
    }
  ],
  "last_updated": "2025-09-14T18:30:00Z",
  "total_games": 6
}
```

For multi-draw games, the backend should return separate game entries for each draw time, which will be grouped in the frontend UI using the tabbed interface.

## Conclusion

The implementation of Dominica and Antigua & Barbuda lottery games is complete and follows all specified requirements. The games are ready to display real data once the scraper integration is complete.

# Jamaica Lottery Results Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Limited Game Display in LotteryCard
**Problem**: The LotteryCard component was only showing 3 games by default due to the [maxGames](file://c:\Users\akacl\Dev\Today's%20Numbers\src\components\cards\LotteryCard.tsx#L11-L11) parameter defaulting to 3.

**Fix**: Updated the Dashboard component to pass `maxGames={12}` to show all Jamaica games.

### 2. Details Button Not Working
**Problem**: The "Details" button in the LotteryCard footer wasn't navigating to the island page properly due to event propagation conflicts.

**Fix**: 
- Added event propagation prevention in the button's onClick handler
- Added a check in the Card's onClick handler to avoid navigation when clicking the button

### 3. Accordion Issues in JamaicaLotteryResults
**Problem**: Accordion components in the JamaicaLotteryResults might not have been expanding properly.

**Fix**: 
- Added proper state management for accordion expansion
- Ensured accordions are expanded by default

### 4. Game Grouping Issues
**Problem**: Some games might not have been properly categorized in the grouping logic.

**Fix**: 
- Added debug logging to verify all games are being processed
- Created a simplified version that shows all games without grouping for verification

### 5. Route Configuration
**Problem**: Duplicate route definitions for [/island/:islandId](file://c:\Users\akacl\Dev\Today's%20Numbers\src\App.tsx#L79-L79).

**Fix**: Removed the duplicate route definition.

# SVG Lottery Cards Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified
1. The SVG lottery page was displaying 5 games instead of the required 4
2. Game labels were incorrect (showing "Daily Cash 4", "Pick 3", etc. instead of "Super 6", "Lotto", "3D", "Play 4")

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the SVG lottery page pulling data from the LotteryContext instead of using only the mock data as required. The context data for SVG contains 5 games with different names than what was specified in the requirements.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Modified SVGLotteryPage.tsx
- Changed the logic to always use mock data instead of real data from context
- Ensured only the 4 required games are displayed: "Super 6", "Lotto", "3D", "Play 4"
- Added console logs for debugging purposes to verify the correct data is being used

### 2. Verified Mock Data
- Confirmed the mock data matches exactly what was specified in NextTask.md
- Verified all required fields are present and correctly formatted

### 3. Updated Implementation Report
- Documented the fixes made
- Updated the access URL in the report

## Verification
- The SVG lottery page now correctly displays only 4 games
- All game labels match the requirements exactly
- All required data fields are displayed properly
- Multi-draw games (3D, Play 4) correctly show Day/Night tabs
- Responsive design works on both desktop and mobile

## Access
The corrected SVG lottery page can be accessed at: http://localhost:5174/svg

## Conclusion
The SVG lottery cards now correctly implement all requirements from NextTask.md with exactly 4 games labeled as specified.

# Implementation Summary: Dominica and Antigua & Barbuda Lottery Games

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of lottery games for Dominica and Antigua & Barbuda in the Today's Numbers application. The implementation follows the existing pattern used for other Caribbean islands and includes all required games with proper data formatting.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/contexts/LotteryContext.tsx`

- Added proper currency formatting (EC$) for both islands
- Implemented multi-draw games using the draws array structure

### 2. `src/App.tsx`
- Added import statements for new test components
- Added new routes for testing the implementation:
  - `/test-da` for basic testing
  - `/test-new-islands` for enhanced testing

## Files Created

### 1. `src/components/TestDominicaAntigua.tsx`
- Basic test component to display lottery cards for both new islands
- Uses the existing LotteryCard component to render the games

### 2. `src/components/TestNewIslands.tsx`
- Enhanced test component with better UI and organization
- Clearly separates the display of Dominica and Antigua & Barbuda games
- Includes descriptive text to explain the purpose of the test page

### 3. `src/__tests__/LotteryContext.test.ts`
- Unit tests to verify that mock data for new islands is correctly implemented
- Tests check for the presence of both islands in the mock data
- Verifies specific games and their properties for both islands

### 4. `src/__tests__/LotteryCard.test.ts`
- Unit tests to verify that the LotteryCard component renders the new islands correctly
- Tests check that multi-draw games display tabs properly
- Verifies that jackpot information is displayed correctly

### 5. `DOMINICA_ANTIGUA_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- Detailed implementation summary document
- Explains the schema compliance and data structure
- Provides information for backend integration

## Implementation Details

### Dominica Games Implemented:
1. **Play 4** - Multi-draw game with Morning, Midday, and Evening draws
2. **Daily 3** - Multi-draw game with Midday and Evening draws
3. **Big 4** - Multi-draw game with Morning and Evening draws
4. **1-Off** - Single draw game
5. **Pick 2** - Multi-draw game with Morning and Evening draws
6. **Super 6** - Single draw game with EC$200,000 jackpot

### Antigua & Barbuda Games Implemented:
1. **Super Lotto** - Single draw game with EC$1,637,500 jackpot
2. **Lucky Pick** - Single draw game

### Data Schema Compliance:
All mock data follows the required schema:
- `island`: String identifier for the island
- `game`: Game name
- `draw_date`: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `draw_time`: Time or label (e.g., "Evening", "21:00")
- `draw_number`: Unique identifier for the draw
- `numbers`: Array of winning numbers
- `jackpot`: Jackpot amount if available
- `drawDateFormatted`: Formatted date for display
- `jackpotFormatted`: Formatted jackpot with currency

### Multi-Draw Game Implementation:
Multi-draw games use the `draws` array structure as specified in the requirements:
- Each draw in the array contains all required fields
- The LotteryCard component already supports this structure through the `isMultiDrawGame` function
- Tabbed interface is automatically rendered for games with multiple draws

### Currency Formatting:
Currency formatting follows the requirements:
- **Dominica**: EC$200,000 for Super 6 jackpot
- **Antigua & Barbuda**: EC$1,637,500 for Super Lotto jackpot

## Verification

The implementation has been verified to ensure:
- All required games are implemented for both islands
- Data follows the specified schema exactly
- Multi-draw games use the correct structure with tabbed interface
- Currency formatting is correct for both islands
- Date formats follow the YYYY-MM-DD specification
- Test components and routes are functional
- No TypeScript or ESLint errors are present

## Backend Integration Requirements

For the backend scraper to properly support these new islands, it will need to:
1. Scrape lottery results from official sources for both islands
2. Return data in the same format as existing islands
3. Map the fields correctly to match the frontend expectations
4. Support multi-draw games by returning separate entries for each draw time

The expected JSON format from the backend:
```json
{
  "island": "Dominica",
  "operator": "Dominica National Lottery",
  "games": [
    {
      "game": "Play 4",
      "numbers": [3, 15, 8, 22],
      "draw_date": "2025-09-14",
      "draw_time": "Evening",
      "draw_number": "20250914-P4",
      "jackpot": null
    },
    {
      "game": "Super 6",
      "numbers": [1, 9, 13, 15, 16, 19],
      "draw_date": "2025-09-12",
      "draw_time": "21:00",
      "draw_number": "20250912-S6",
      "jackpot": 200000
    }
  ],
  "last_updated": "2025-09-14T18:30:00Z",
  "total_games": 6
}
```

For multi-draw games, the backend should return separate game entries for each draw time, which will be grouped in the frontend UI using the tabbed interface.

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:5178/test-new-islands
3. Verify that both Dominica and Antigua & Barbuda lottery cards are displayed correctly
4. Check that multi-draw games show tabs for each draw time
5. Verify that jackpot information is displayed with correct currency formatting

## Conclusion

The implementation of Dominica and Antigua & Barbuda lottery games is complete and follows all specified requirements. The games are ready to display real data once the scraper integration is complete. All existing functionality remains unchanged, and the implementation follows the same patterns used for other Caribbean islands in the application.

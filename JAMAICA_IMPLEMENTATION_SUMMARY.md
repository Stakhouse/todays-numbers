### Data Structure
The implementation follows the provided mock JSON structure:
```json
[
  {
    "island_name": "Jamaica",
    "game_name": "Cash Pot",
    "draw_date": "2025-09-08",
    "draw_number": "2025090801",
    "draw_time": "08:30",
    "numbers": [5]
  },
  {
    "island_name": "Jamaica",
    "game_name": "Pick 3",

```

## Testing
The implementation has been tested with the provided mock JSON data and displays correctly with all required fields and placeholders.

## Next Steps
1. Integration with the actual scraper backend for real-time data
2. Additional styling refinements based on user feedback
3. Performance optimizations for handling large amounts of data

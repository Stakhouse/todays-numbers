# SVG Lottery Cards Implementation Report

## Overview
This report documents the implementation of the SVG public main-page cards for Today's Numbers as specified in the NextTask.md file.

## Implementation Summary

### Components Created
1. **SVGLotteryCard.tsx** - Reusable card component for displaying SVG lottery game data
2. **SVGLotteryCard.css** - Styling for the lottery cards
3. **SVGLotteryPage.tsx** - Main page component that displays all four SVG lottery games

### Games Implemented
- ✅ Super 6
- ✅ Lotto
- ✅ 3D
- ✅ Play 4

### Features Implemented

#### Data Fields Display
All required data fields are displayed clearly and visibly:
- Game title
- Draw date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Draw time (HH:MM or label)
- Draw number (or "N/A" if null)
- Numbers (styled as number bubbles/badges)
- Jackpot (when present)

#### UI Requirements
- ✅ Each game is a distinct Card component on the main page
- ✅ Cards display all required fields clearly and visibly
- ✅ Responsive design (grid on desktop, stacked on mobile)
- ✅ Multi-draw games (3D, Play 4) show multiple recent draws with Day/Night tabs
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing fields ("Pending" or "N/A" - no crashes)

#### Data Source Integration
- ✅ Started with mock JSON as specified in requirements
- ✅ Structure ready for real scraped data from Lottery Guru/NLASVG
- ✅ Scraper output will map exactly to the required fields

## Mock Data Used
The implementation uses the exact mock JSON specified in the requirements:

```json
[
  {
    "island": "St. Vincent & the Grenadines",
    "game": "Super 6",
    "draw_date": "2025-09-09",
    "draw_time": "21:00",
    "draw_number": "20250909-S6",
    "numbers": [2, 9, 24, 31, 35, 16],
    "jackpot": "EC$100,000"
  },
  {
    "island": "St. Vincent & the Grenadines",
    "game": "Lotto",
    "draw_date": "2025-09-10",
    "draw_time": "18:30",
    "draw_number": "20250910-JF",
    "numbers": [7, 11, 4, 2, 9],
    "jackpot": null
  },
  {
    "island": "St. Vincent & the Grenadines",
    "game": "3D",
    "draw_date": "2025-09-11",
    "draw_time": "Night",
    "draw_number": "20250911-3D-N",
    "numbers": [4, 8, 2]
  },
  {
    "island": "St. Vincent & the Grenadines",
    "game": "Play 4",
    "draw_date": "2025-09-11",
    "draw_time": "Day",
    "draw_number": "20250911-P4-D",
    "numbers": [1, 3, 7, 5]
  }
]
```

## Testing & Acceptance

### Verification Checklist
- ✅ Load the mock JSON and render one Card per entry exactly as specified
- ✅ Cards display all required fields and handle missing values gracefully
- ✅ For 3D and Play 4, confirm the Card can show more than one recent draw (Day & Night tabs)
- ✅ Mobile and desktop layouts verified
- ✅ After mock verification, structure is ready for real scraped JSON

### Selector Notes for Scraper Hookup
The component structure is designed to work with real data from scrapers:
- Field names match exactly with the required specification
- Data structure supports multiple draws for 3D and Play 4 games
- Graceful fallback for missing data fields

## Access
The SVG lottery page can be accessed at: http://localhost:5174/svg

## Recent Fixes
- Fixed issue where real data from context was being used instead of mock data
- Ensured only the 4 required games are displayed (Super 6, Lotto, 3D, Play 4)
- Verified correct game labels are being used
- Added console logs for debugging purposes

## Conclusion
All requirements from the NextTask.md file have been successfully implemented. The SVG lottery cards are functional, responsive, and ready for integration with real scraped data from Lottery Guru or NLASVG.
